Visualization
- deaths in the mediterranean
- print number of people
- Draw paths between countries
- WebGl particles between them

UI
- Deal with refugee.ready 
- When selecting a month, highlights months in between for cool effect
- control by arrow keys
- hover over month for world events

Errors:
- Last latest months are weird since some values are not yet updated in the database

Optimizations:
- stop animating when no change on screen
